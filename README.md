## PRODIGY_ML_03
Introduction:
This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The data used in this project comes from the popular "Dogs vs. Cats" Kaggle dataset. By leveraging the SVM algorithm, the goal is to develop a robust classifier that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
In the EDA phase, I examined the dataset's structure, visualized sample images, and explored class distributions. Key preprocessing steps, including image resizing and scaling, were applied to prepare the data for model training. This analysis provided insights into data characteristics and influenced the preprocessing and model selection process.
